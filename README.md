# CAP478 — Data Communication & Networking Laboratory

**Lovely Professional University**

Short: This repository contains Cisco Packet Tracer lab files (.pkt) completed for the CAP478 laboratory course. The labs demonstrate practical networking concepts: topology design, IP addressing, subnetting, routing (static & dynamic), and common application services (HTTP, DNS, DHCP, SMTP, FTP).

## Course Overview

Course: CAP478 — Data Communication and Networking Laboratory

This repository holds the Packet Tracer simulations created during the course. Each `.pkt` file represents a lab exercise or assessment used to practice network design, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Course Outcomes

- CO1: Understand fundamental data flow concepts and selection criteria for transmission media.
- CO2: Demonstrate IP allocation and subnet creation techniques.
- CO3: Compare and contrast static and dynamic routing protocols.
- CO4: Assess application-layer services (HTTP, DNS, DHCP, SMTP, FTP) in networked environments.

The repository includes these Packet Tracer files (complete list):

- `hub.pkt` — Hub network examples
- `startopologies.pkt` — Basic topologies
- `mesh topologies.pkt` — Mesh topology exercises
- `router.pkt`, `3 router.pkt` — Router configuration labs
- `static router.pkt`, `static routing.pkt`, `STATIC & DYNAMIC ROUTER.pkt` — Static routing labs
- `dynamic routing.pkt`, `dynamic routing with 3 router.pkt` — RIP / dynamic routing labs
- `subnetting.pkt`, `Subnetting_Solved.pkt`, `subnating.pkt` — Subnetting and FLSM exercises
- `http.pkt`, `http learning.pkt`, `http 2nd lec.pkt` — HTTP server and web access
- `dns.pkt`, `server and dns.pkt`, `dnsp.pkt` — DNS configuration and name resolution
- `dhcp.pkt`, `dhcp using server.pkt` — DHCP server and client demonstrations
- `EMAIL.pkt`, `EMAIL & FTP.pkt`, `emailserver2.pkt`, `smtp.pkt`, `smptp_email.pkt` — Email / SMTP labs
- `ftp.pkt` — FTP server lab
- Assessment & assignments: `CA2.pkt`, `CA3DCN.pkt`, `Assing1.pkt`, `Exercise.pkt`

If you need a specific file listed in the root but not mentioned above, all `.pkt` files are present in the repository root — open them directly with Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Software Requirements

- Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x recommended)

Download and install Packet Tracer from Cisco Networking Academy. Open `.pkt` files using Packet Tracer.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitish-niraj/networking-cisco-packet-tracer.git
```

2. Open any `.pkt` file with Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Use Real-Time mode to interact with devices or Simulation mode to step through PDUs.

## Suggested Learning Path

1. Start with `hub.pkt` and `startopologies.pkt` to learn basic device behavior.
2. Practice IP addressing and subnetting using the subnetting exercises.
3. Configure routers for static routing, then try dynamic routing (RIP) labs.
4. Set up and test application services: HTTP, DNS, DHCP, SMTP, FTP.
