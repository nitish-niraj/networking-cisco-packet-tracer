# CAP478: Data Communication and Networking Laboratory

**Institution:** Lovely Professional University

## Course Overview

This repository contains all the laboratory exercises and network simulations completed during the **CAP478: Data Communication and Networking Laboratory** course. The labs demonstrate practical networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Course Outcomes

- **CO1:** Understand the fundamental concepts of data flow and criteria for the selection of transmission media.
- **CO2:** Demonstrate the techniques for IP allocation in the networks and creation of subnets.
- **CO3:** Contrast between static and dynamic routing protocols.
- **CO4:** Assess the working of various application layer services in the network.
